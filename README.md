#[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shritesh/shritesh.github.io.svg?branch=jekyll)](https://travis-ci.org/shritesh/shritesh.github.io)

#This is the source repository for my personal website at http://shritesh.com.

#Github Pages does not support external themes (yet), so Travis CI is used to
#build from the `jekyll` branch and commit into the `master` branch.
