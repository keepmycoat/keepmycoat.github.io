I'm Shritesh Bhattarai, and I love to build things on the web.

I'm a co-founder of [SafeSurv][1], a provider of trust and identity verification
platform for businesses, and [Feature Studios][2], a creative multimedia agency.

I attend [Tennessee Tech University][3] where I'm majoring in Computer Science.

I keep a [now page][4] where I update what I'm doing.

I'm @shritesh on [Twitter][5] and [GitHub][6].

You can email me at [shritesh@shritesh.com][7].
