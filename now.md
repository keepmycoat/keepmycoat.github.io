# What I'm Doing Now

Most of the time, I'm living the startup life at [SafeSurv][1], doing everything
from programming and design to "business" and managing infrastructure. I'm also
building an iOS app for flood prediction with my [university research group][2].

I intend to write a blog post and read (at least) one book every week in 2017. I
need to get my creative juices flowing again.

I'm trying my best to live a healthy lifestyle by going to bed and getting up on
time, hit the gym a lot and watch my calories.
